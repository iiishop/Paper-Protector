### Overview

Paper Protector is an automated IoT system that detects and removes moisture from paper documents through intelligent scanning and directional drying technology. Integrating precision stepper motor control, DHT22 environmental sensors (previously utilizing the AS7341 to measure paper humidity), and real-time network visualization, the system automatically identifies damp areas and applies targeted heating until documents are completely dry.
